# Synapx Assignment

## Overview
This project runs the processing pipeline using `Synapx_Assignment.ipynb`.  
It loads data, prepares it, runs the model/steps, and shows results.

---

## Approach (Simple)
1. Setup environment and install libraries  
2. Load input data  
3. Preprocess data  
4. Run notebook pipeline  
5. View/save output results  

---

## How to Run

### Option 1 — Google Colab (Easy)
1. Open Google Colab
2. Upload `Synapx_Assignment.ipynb`
3. Runtime → Change runtime → **GPU**
4. Run all cells (`Shift + Enter`)

---

### Option 2 — Run Locally

#### Install dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### Start notebook
```bash
jupyter notebook
```

#### Run
Open `Synapx_Assignment.ipynb` and run all cells.

---

## Notes
- Using GPU makes execution faster
- If runtime restarts, run cells again
- Check file paths if errors occur
