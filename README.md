# Autonomous Insurance Claims Processing Agent

## Overview
This project demonstrates an automated pipeline for processing insurance claims using the notebook:

`Autonomous_Insurance_Claims_Processing_Agent.ipynb`

The notebook loads data, prepares inputs, runs the processing/model steps, and displays results.

---

## Approach
1. Setup environment and install required libraries  
2. Load claim data/images  
3. Preprocess inputs for the pipeline  
4. Execute processing/model steps  
5. Generate and view results  

---

## How to Run

### Option 1 — Google Colab (Recommended)
1. Open Google Colab  
2. Upload `Autonomous_Insurance_Claims_Processing_Agent.ipynb`  
3. Runtime → Change runtime type → **GPU**  
4. Run all cells (`Shift + Enter`)  

---

### Option 2 — Run Locally

#### Install dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### Start notebook
```bash
jupyter notebook
```

#### Execute
Open `Autonomous_Insurance_Claims_Processing_Agent.ipynb` and run all cells.

---

## Notes
- GPU execution is faster  
- If runtime restarts, rerun all cells  
- Verify file paths if errors occur
